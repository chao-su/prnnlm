 |5| okay |8| , |26| uh |8| , 
 |20| could |12| you |10| tell |12| me |30| what |12| you |19| think |16| contributes |25| most |14| to |8| , |26| uh |8| , |1| air |1| pollution |7| ? 
 |11| well |8| , |12| it |16| 's |5| hard |14| to |10| say |7| . 
 |0| i |1| mean |8| , |2| while |12| it |16| 's |11| certainly |4| the |1| case |2| that |6| things |2| like |6| automobiles |13| and |6| factories |8| , |26| uh |8| , |10| pollute |4| a |1| lot |8| , |26| uh |8| , |2| if |12| you |19| look |2| at |31| how |5| much |1| pollution |16| is |10| say |15| kicked |28| up |2| by |4| an |5| active |1| <unk> |8| , |26| uh |8| , |12| it |16| 's |11| certainly |29| less |2| than |5| clear |2| that |1| anything |1| man |20| can |10| do |2| in |4| this |1| sort |2| of |1| scale |2| of |6| things |16| has |5| much |1| effect |2| at |4| all |7| . 
 |30| what |19| do |12| you |10| think |7| ? 
 |11| um |8| , |11| well |8| , |12| you |9| talked |2| about |8| , |26| uh |8| , |6| <unk> |7| . 
 |0| i |19| 'm |11| not |5| sure |31| how |5| many |5| active |6| <unk> |34| there |19| are |11| now |8| , |13| and |8| , |13| and |30| what |4| the |1| amount |2| of |1| material |2| that |12| they |19| do |8| , |26| uh |8| , |15| put |2| into |4| the |1| atmosphere |7| . 
 |0| i |10| think |11| probably |4| the |25| greatest |1| cause |16| is |8| , |26| uh |8| , |6| vehicles |8| , 
 |5| uh-huh |7| . 
 |11| especially |2| around |6| cities |7| . 
 |11| um |8| , |26| uh |8| , |19| do |12| you |10| live |11| right |2| in |4| the |1| city |12| itself |7| ? 
 |11| no |8| , 
 |0| i |10| 'm |29| more |2| out |2| in |4| the |6| suburbs |8| , 
 |13| but |0| i |11| certainly |1| work |2| near |4| a |1| city |7| . 
 |5| okay |8| , 
 |11| so |5| ca- |8| , 
 |31| how |2| about |12| you |7| ? 
 |20| can |12| you |10| notice |8| , 
 |11| well |12| it |16| 's |8| , |12| it |16| 's |8| , 
 |0| i |10| live |2| in |4| a |5| rural |1| area |7| . 
 |5| uh-huh |7| . 
 |12| it |16| 's |11| mainly |6| farms |13| and |8| , |26| uh |8| , |4| no |5| heavy |1| industry |7| . 
 |1| <unk> |8| , |12| itself |8| , 
 |0| i |5| live |26| in |26| <unk> |1| island |7| . 
 |26| oh |8| , |26| i |10| see |7| . 
 |13| and |8| , |12| it |16| 's |2| in |4| the |1| north |8| , 
 |0| i |10| live |28| up |2| in |4| the |8| , |26| uh |8| , |5| northeast |1| corner 
 |13| and |1| <unk> |16| sits |2| in |11| just |2| over |4| the |1| line |8| , 
 |5| uh-huh |7| . 
 |31| where |1| t |26| i |24| 's |1| plant |16| is |8| , 
 |13| but |34| there |16| is |11| n't |4| a |1| lot |2| of |5| heavy |1| industry |7| . 
 |34| there |16| 's |4| the |6| <unk> 
 |13| and |12| we |19| get |4| an |5| occasional |8| , 
 |12| it |16| depends |27| which |1| way |4| the |1| wind |24| 's |1| blowing |2| from |1| boston |8| , |1| cause |12| we |19| 're |2| like |17| forty |6| miles |11| south |2| of |1| boston |8| , 
 |11| so |12| we |20| 'll |10| pick |28| up |4| that |7| . 
 |13| and |8| , |26| uh |8| , |26| i |19| 've |15| noticed |2| over |4| the |5| past |1| say |8| , |11| maybe |17| five |13| or |17| six |6| years |8| , |26| uh |8| , 
 |12| we |19| live |2| about |17| twenty |6| miles |11| away |2| from |4| the |1| state |1| airport 
 |13| and |26| i |1| notice |2| that |4| the |1| fly |6| patterns |11| now |2| of |4| the |6| <unk> |19| are |18| getting |29| bigger |8| , 
 |12| they |19| 're |18| <unk> |29| wider |2| so |2| that |11| now |12| they |19| are |18| coming |2| over |8| , |2| over |22| our |6| homes |7| . 
 |5| uh-huh |7| . 
 |13| and |8| , |12| it |16| seems |2| like |8| , |26| uh |8| , |12| we |19| 're |18| catching |38| all |4| that |1| <unk> |7| . 
 |0| i |19| 'm |11| not |5| sure |2| if |12| it |16| 's |1| <unk> |13| or |30| what |4| that |16| 's |18| dropping |7| . 
 |13| but |8| , |5| other |2| than |4| that |8| , |12| you |19| know |8| , |12| we |19| do |11| n't |10| have |4| the |8| , |2| unless |12| we |19| 're |18| catching |12| it |2| from |4| the |5| midwest |8| , |4| the |6| emissions |7| . 
 |1| yeah |7| . 
 |12| you |19| know |2| from |4| the |1| power |6| plants |7| . |1| um |7| . 
 |12| you |19| mean |2| like |2| from |4| the |1| coal |7| . 
 |11| yeah |8| , 
 |11| yeah |8| , 
 |12| we |19| generate |8| , 
 |17| one |2| of |22| our |8| , |22| our |25| biggest |5| electrical |6| plants |2| in |1| <unk> |1| island |16| uses |1| coal |14| to |8| , |26| uh |8| , 
 |11| um |8| , 
 |10| generate |1| electricity |7| . 
 |11| um |8| , |34| there |16| does |11| n't |10| seem |14| to |10| be |5| much |1| emission |2| from |12| them |8| , 
 |13| but |0| i |19| 'm |11| not |5| sure |2| about |4| the |1| rest |2| of |4| the |1| country |7| . 
 |11| yeah |8| , 
 |0| i |1| notice |11| locally |4| a |5| major |1| problem |16| is |1| <unk> |7| . 
 |11| um |8| , |12| it |16| 's |5| interesting 
 |2| because |2| in |1| order |14| to |8| , |26| uh |8| , |10| keep |2| with |4| the |0| e |1| p |4| a |6| standards |27| which |8| , |27| which |19| tend |14| to |10| be |5| visible |8| , |26| uh |8| , |30| what |16| 's |18| coming |2| out |2| of |22| your |1| <unk> |8| , |12| they |19| do |4| all |22| their |6| emissions |2| at |1| night |7| .
