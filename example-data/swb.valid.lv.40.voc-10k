 |11| um |8| , |4| all |1| right |7| . 
 |0| i |19| 've |8| , |26| uh |8| , 
 |11| as |11| far |2| as |26| i |19| 'm |5| concerned |8| , |26| i |19| find |2| that |4| the |5| young |6| women |19| have |15| lost |11| so |11| much |2| because |12| they |19| have |15| become |35| more |5| aggressive |13| and |35| more |18| <unk> |8| , 
 |13| and |0| i |1| think |27| that |16| comes |2| about |2| from |22| their |18| being |4| a |5| definite |1| factor |2| in |4| the |1| job |1| market |11| now |7| . 
 |5| uh-huh |7| . 
 |26| oh |8| , |11| well |8| , |26| i |10| tend |8| , |26| i |10| tend |14| to |10| agree |7| . 
 |26| uh |8| , |2| in |4| some |6| ways |0| i |10| think |12| it |16| 's |8| , |26| uh |8| , |26| i |10| think |2| if |1| anything |8| , |4| a |1| lot |2| of |8| , |1| um |8| , |4| the |6| changes |27| that |19| have |15| occurred |8| , |26| uh |8| , 
 |2| in |4| some |6| ways |12| they |19| 're |2| for |4| the |29| better 
 |2| because |26| i |10| think |6| women |20| should |10| have |4| a |1| choice |8| , 
 |13| and |0| i |19| do |10| believe |2| in |4| the |8| , |18| being |5| able |14| to |10| have |4| a |1| choice |2| as |14| to |8| , |11| as |11| far |2| as |8| , |30| what |12| you |20| would |10| like |14| to |10| do |2| with |22| your |1| life |7| . 
 |13| but |2| by |4| the |5| same |5| token |8| , |13| and |0| i |10| know |4| this |2| for |12| myself |2| because |26| i |19| 've |15| worked |13| and |26| i |19| 've |11| not |15| worked |8| , |1| um |8| , 
 |2| that |12| it |16| makes |12| it |8| , |26| uh |8| , |11| sometimes |12| it |16| makes |1| life |35| more |5| difficult |7| . 
 |0| i |1| think |31| when |4| the |6| roles |11| now |19| are |35| less |15| defined |8| , |11| as |11| far |2| as |8| , |12| you |19| know |8| , |30| what |8| , |26| uh |8| , |6| women |20| should |13| or |20| should |11| not |10| be |18| doing |8| , |2| that |12| it |8| , |12| it |8| , |12| it |20| could |10| make |1| life |35| more |5| difficult |7| . 
 |34| there |19| are |29| more |6| things |14| to |10| work |28| out |7| . 
 |0| i |10| know |31| when |0| i |9| was |18| working |8| , |12| you |19| know |8| , |12| you |19| have |4| all |4| these |6| problems |2| with |8| , |2| with |4| the |1| child |1| care |13| and |8| , |13| and |2| with |8| , |26| uh |8| , |1| <unk> |8| , |12| you |19| know |8| , |22| your |1| boss |2| on |4| the |1| job |8| , 
 |11| so |12| you |19| have |15| added |6| <unk> |2| from |34| there 
 |13| and |11| then |12| you |11| still |10| have |38| all |4| the |6| things |27| that |8| , |1| um |8| , |2| that |12| you |19| need |14| to |10| do |2| at |1| home 
 |13| and |4| that |16| does |11| n't |10| change |8| , |12| you |19| know |8| , 
 |11| just |2| because |22| your |18| going |2| out |2| of |4| the |1| house |2| for |11| so |5| many |6| hours |4| a |1| day |16| does |11| n't |8| , |26| uh |8| , |19| make |4| those |5| other |6| things |19| go |11| away 
 |13| and |4| the |5| other |6| responsibilities |19| are |11| still |5| important |7| . 
 |11| um |8| , 
 |11| so |8| , |1| um |8| , |19| have |12| you |8| , |10| have |12| you |9| worked |5| outside |8| , |11| also |13| and |8| , |1| um |8| , |19| feel |2| that |8| , |12| it |8| , |2| that |8| ,

 |13| and |11| now |2| that |22| my |1| husband |16| has |15| retired |8| , |0| i |11| am |11| back |5| substitute |1| teaching |8| , 
 |11| yes |7| . 
 |27| which |2| if |1| anyone |16| has |11| ever |15| been |15| involved |2| in |4| that |8| , |4| some |6| days |12| it |16| 's |1| fun 
 |13| and |4| some |6| days |12| you |19| wonder |31| why |12| you |19| 're |11| even |18| bothering |8| , 
 |11| right |7| . 
 |2| because |22| your |1| fighting |2| for |22| your |1| life |7| .

 |11| yes |7| . 
 |13| and |8| , |13| and |0| i |19| have |4| no |1| problem |2| with |4| that |8| , 
 |13| but |26| i |19| think |4| the |1| male |16| needs |14| to |10| be |4| the |5| dominant |1| person |7| . 
 |13| and |26| i |10| think |11| too |5| many |2| of |4| the |5| young |5| professional |6| wives |2| in |22| our |5| small |1| town |2| of |17| five |17| thousand |8| , |26| uh |8| , 
 |5| uh-huh |7| . 
 |19| are |11| not |18| letting |2| that |10| happen |7| .

 |13| and |12| they |19| have |14| to |10| be |2| in |1| charge |7| . 
 |13| and |8| , 
 |5| uh-huh |7| . 
 |13| and |26| i |26| th- |8| , |0| i |19| think |12| they |19| lose |4| a |1| lot |2| by |30| what |0| i |10| call |18| <unk> |22| their |6| husbands |7| . 
 |6| children |11| well |8| , |30| what |19| do |12| you |10| think |8| , |10| <unk> |18| running 
 |11| though |8| , |1| um |8| , |1| um |8| , 
 |0| i |19| do |11| n't |10| know |7| . 
 |0| i |8| , 
 |4| the |8| , |4| the |17| one |1| problem |26| i |10| guess |26| i |10| have |8| , 
 |13| and |11| maybe |30| what |11| so |5| many |6| women |8| , |29| younger |6| women |11| now |19| are |18| choosing |14| to |10| go |5| outside |16| is |8| , 
 |0| i |1| feel |2| that |2| in |5| general |8| , |2| in |4| this |1| society |8| , |2| that |18| being |2| at |1| home |16| is |11| not |15| looked |2| upon |2| as |8| , |1| um |8| , |4| a |1| job |2| in |12| itself |7| . 
 |2| whereas |8| , |12| you |19| know |8| , |12| you |19| hear |4| a |1| lot |2| of |6| women |27| that |19| are |1| home |18| saying |2| that |12| it |16| is |4| a |1| job |2| in |12| itself |8| , 
 |13| but |0| i |10| know |31| when |0| i |9| was |18| working |8| , 
 |13| and |0| i |9| was |3| a- |8| , |4| an |1| engineer |2| so |26| i |9| was |11| always |2| with |6| men |8| , 
 |26| uh |8| , |13| and |12| they |9| were |5| single |8| , |5| many |2| of |12| them |8| , 
 |13| and |0| i |9| tried |14| to |10| explain |14| to |12| them |8| , |11| well |8| , |22| my |1| day |16| does |11| n't |10| end |31| when |26| i |1| leave |2| at |8| , 
 |0| i |15| used |14| to |10| leave |2| at |17| three |8| , 
 |5| uh-huh |7| . 
 |0| i |10| keep |18| going |14| to |6| eleven |2| at |1| night 
 |13| and |12| they |9| had |8| , |12| they |9| used |14| to |10| look |28| down |2| on |6| women |27| that |9| were |1| home |8| , 
 |12| they |20| 'd |10| say |8| , |26| oh |8| , |26| i |10| bet |12| you |10| go |1| home |13| and |8| , 
 |12| you |19| know |8| , |2| at |25| least |12| you |19| get |2| out |2| of |11| here |2| at |17| three 
 |13| and |12| you |20| can |10| go |1| home |13| and |10| put |22| your |6| feet |11| up |13| and |10| watch |1| soap |6| operas |8| , 
 |26| oh |8| , |5| sure |7| . 
 |13| and |0| i |15| used |14| to |10| be |15| <unk> |8| , 
 |5| uh-huh |7| . 
 |2| because |12| they |11| really |9| had |4| no |1| idea |30| what |9| was |15| involved |11| once |0| i |9| got |1| home |7| . 
 |11| now |18| taking |1| care |2| of |12| them |8| , |18| running |12| them |11| everywhere |8| , |18| helping |2| with |1| homework |8| , |4| the |1| bath |8| , |4| the |1| whole |8| , |12| you |19| know |8| , |1| everything |7| . 
 |11| um |8| , |13| and |0| i |19| think |2| that |17| one |1| reason |2| that |11| so |5| many |29| younger |6| women |19| feel |1| im- |8| , |1| i- |8| , |15| <unk> |14| to |10| go |2| into |4| a |1| profession |16| is |2| that |12| they |19| feel |2| that |2| if |12| they |19| stay |11| home |12| they |19| are |11| not |15| respected |8| , 
 |11| huh |7| . 
 |13| and |2| that |18| being |1| home |16| is |11| not |4| a |5| respectable |8| , |26| uh |8| , |1| position |2| in |1| society |7| . 
 |13| and |8| , |34| there |16| 's |4| a |1| lot |2| of |1| truth |14| to |4| that 
 |13| and |0| i |19| do |11| n't |10| know |31| how |12| you |19| feel |7| . 
 |0| i |19| do |11| n't |10| know |31| how |12| you |9| felt |31| when |12| you |9| were |1| home |13| and |27| what |1| kind |2| of |1| feedback |12| you |9| got |8| , 
 |13| but |0| i |20| can |10| see |2| with |4| the |29| younger |6| men |2| that |12| they |11| definitely |19| are |18| looking |28| down |2| upon |6| women |27| that |19| are |1| home |7| .
